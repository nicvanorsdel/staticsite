<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Nicholas Van Orsdel and I’m currently a senior at the University of Minnesota. My studyings include double majoring in Political Science and Technical Writing and Communication. As I’m nearing graduation, I’m currently applying for law schools in hopes to attend law school. I would like to focus on corporate law, and have been applying to schools that specialize in this field of law. </p>
<p>While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I have had multiple internships at various companies. The companies can be seen below. </p>
<ul>
        <li>American Family Insurance</li>
        <li>Local Government Association</li>
        <li>Pemberton Law Firm</li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, working for the Local Government Association (LGA) was one of my more exciting experiences. The <a href=”https://www.local.gov.uk/”>LGA</a>was a political organization I worked for while studying and working in London. For background on the LGA, click on the link for more information. With all the experience I have gained inside and outside the classroom, I’m situated right where I need to be in terms of preparing for law school.</p>
<p>The picture below is from a trip I took while studying in London. I vistited Scotland and had the chance to hike around a majority of the Scottish Isles.</p>
